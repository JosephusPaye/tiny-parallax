# tiny-parallax
A very simple and easy to use parallax plugin that is less than 2kb. I was annoyed using other parallax plugins that were too heavy. 




<b>USEAGE :</b>

jQuery("element").tinyparallax();


<b>Options :</b>

There are of course some simple options to help customize the end result

<ul>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
